## üìñ History
Cryptex started out in November 2021 with one developer Alex "cythes" Kollar as an attempt to be less of a script kiddy.
It has since became so much more. As of april 2022 Alex decided to open the project up to the SSG community to some absolutely incredible results. At this point the SSG | Cryptex Dev Team was founded with a the idea of building cryptex into a cryptography tool that people could use, install and add to with ease. Similar to metasploit. The project and team has evolved so much in just the little time it has existed.  
  
Cryptex itself maturing from Alex's seventeen original Hodge-podge of unoptimized tools, to what is now a professional grade cryptography toolkit. Cryptex is backed by a passionate team of devs ranging from beginners looking for a place to start to advanced devs who want a challenge. We even have a few idea men who come up with whacky encryption ideas for us to try to impliment. (Static Encryption. Go check it out.) Last but 110% not least our sponors who believe in the project enough to financially back us. 
  
## üóìÔ∏è Upcoming Release
### Cryptex V1.0.0 - Pumpkin Patch 00  
After participation in Hacktoberfest 2022 we are going to put the collective updates from the event into a new realease. We are Dubbing the Pumpkin Patch. The plan is every year we do Hacktoberfest we will add a new Pumpkin Patch to Cryptex.  
  
Other notes: 
- We are moving away from the Earth Invader. 
- complete rebuild of cryptex to work with Object Oriented Programming. 
- Its now easier to implement new Ciphers and tools.   
- Installer has been rewritten from the ground up in python.
- The main menu can now dynamically add ciphers and tools to the list.
- We brought back the OG 'Cryptex UI' (We made it look pretty again)
- Implimented a system that lets us use Ascii art for version names.

All of this is pushing Cryptex ever closer to its goal of becoming the `metaploit of cryptography`
