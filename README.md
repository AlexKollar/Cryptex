## 📖 History
Cryptex started out in November, 2021, with one developer, Alex "cythes" Kollar, as an attempt to be less of a script kiddie.
It has since then became so much more. As of April, 2022, Alex decided to open the project up to the SSG community to reap some absolutely incredible results. At this point, the SSG | Cryptex Dev Team was founded with a the idea of building Cryptex into a cryptography tool that people could use, install and add to with ease. Similar to Metasploit, the project and the team has evolved so much in the little time that it has existed for.  
  
Cryptex itself has matured from Alex's hodgepodge of seventeen original but unoptimized tools, to what is now a professional-grade cryptography toolkit. Cryptex is backed by a passionate team of devs, ranging from beginners looking for a place to start, to advanced devs who want a challenge. We even have a few idea men who come up with wacky encryption ideas for us to try to implement. (Static Encryption; go check it out!) Lastly, but definitely not the least, this has been possible thanks to our sponsors who believe in the project enough to financially back us up. 
  
## 🗓️ Upcoming Release
### Cryptex V2.0.0 - DevNull 
Cryptex DevNull will be highly focused on bringing together Cryptographic Malware in a **SAFE** way so people can experiment with and learn how these kinds of things work. We are calling this system **Cryptex | Cryodes**. With our first Cryode "Loki" was published as part of Cryptex v1.0.0 as a teaser. While Loki is not fully finished yet the core functions work out of the box. If you want to keep up with Loki and the rest of the Cryodes development process go check out the beta branch for all the latest and greatest goodies Cryptex has to offer.
  
Other notes: 
- Cryodes System Implimentation
- Planned QOL improvements
- Reworked Menu System
- Crossplatform Support (Mac / Windows)

> All of this is pushing Cryptex ever closer to its goal of becoming the `Metaploit of cryptography`
